Overview
Welcome to the Face Recognition Attendance System, a project developed by Myself, Dinesh.S from B.TECH IT. This system is designed to automate the attendance marking process using face recognition technology. It detects faces, recognizes registered students, and marks their attendance accordingly. For unrecognized faces, it displays them as unknown.

Features
Face Detection: Utilizes state-of-the-art face detection algorithms to accurately locate faces in images or live video streams.
Face Recognition: Implements deep learning-based face recognition techniques to identify registered students and mark their attendance.
Attendance Management: Stores attendance records securely in a database for easy access and analysis.
User-friendly Interface: Provides a simple and intuitive interface for administrators to manage student data and view attendance reports.
Technologies Used
Python
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library)
Dlib (Machine Learning Library)
Firebase (For storage and real-time database)

Usage
Administrator Functions:
Add new students to the system for recognition.
View attendance records and export them if needed.
Student/Attendee Perspective:
No direct interaction is needed from students. Attendance is marked automatically when their faces are recognized.
